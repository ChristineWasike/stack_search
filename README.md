## Inspiration
No one enjoys the long hours and wasted time before you find the right spray to your bug.

## What it does
Leverages the wealth of stack sites and their api's to get you the best and most relevant answers so you no longer need to google your bugs.

## How I built it
Consumed api's provided by the Stack sites so that all searched are done against realtime data. Provided the core functionality in a graphql based Api so that anyone can intergrate it into anything they want, from text editors, ide's mobile apps, bots, etc.

## Challenges I ran into
Material on the Api's.
New to React (mainly a front-end dev).
My team went silent on me.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
The backend api.
Making graphql work.


## What I learned

## What's next for Stack Search
Hopefully a messenger bot to start with and then atom and code integration to start with.
